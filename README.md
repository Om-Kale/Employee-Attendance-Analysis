# Employee Attendance Analysis

## Description

This project involves analyzing employee attendance data to uncover insights related to work hours, attendance patterns, and departmental performance. The analysis leverages SQL and window functions to solve various business problems and enhance understanding of data trends.

## Why SQL and Window Functions?

SQL is essential for querying and managing relational data efficiently. Window functions, a powerful feature of SQL, allow for advanced calculations across sets of rows related to the current row. They are crucial for performing operations like cumulative sums, rolling averages, and rankings, which are frequently needed in data analysis.

In this project, SQL window functions were utilized to:
- Enhance hands-on experience with these advanced features.
- Solve complex analytical problems related to employee work hours and attendance patterns.
